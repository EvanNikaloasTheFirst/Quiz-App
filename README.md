Quiz API:

Here I took it upon myself to create a project using my knowledge from a youtube course I took about web APIs (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZvSYJDk-us).

I expanded my knowledge and problem-solving abilities as I used resources such as StackOverflow instead of using Youtube tutorials as I'm looking to improve my logic skillset.

To use the application you simply answer a question and once the response to the question has been displayed (Correct / Incorrect) the True or False buttons are disabled and prompt you to proceed to the next question.
